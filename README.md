# SWIFTDOCS-23-opaque-types
Swift documentation → A function or method with an opaque return type hides its return value’s type information. Instead of providing a concrete type as the function’s return type, the return value is described in terms of the protocols it supports. Hiding type information is useful at boundaries between a module and code that calls into the module, because the underlying type of the return value can remain private.
